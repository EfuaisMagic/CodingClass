/* Element  Selectors*/

/*      
The simplest application of specifying which HTML elements you wish to style using CSS
is to target all like elements with one selector.
EXAMPLE:
You want to style all bolded text on your page. 
Just type the <b> tag once
and create style rules. 
They will apply to all HTML elements with the <b> tag.

b { 
	color: orange
}
