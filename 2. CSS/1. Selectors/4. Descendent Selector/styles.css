Descendent Selectors                                     
The next step in specifying elements you want to style withh CSS
is to target descendents or elements nested within other elements.
EXAMPLE:
You want to style only the bolded text nested within <li> elements. 
type the parent tag first, then a space (not a comma)
and then the tag immediately enclosing the target text.*/
